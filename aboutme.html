            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated Web and Software Development student pursuing an A.A.S. degree at MATC, 
                with an expected graduation date in May 2026. My passion lies in creating innovative and 
                user-centered web and software solutions that bring ideas to life. I am eager to apply my 
                skills through internships or entry-level roles, where I can gain hands-on experience and 
                contribute to meaningful projects. With a proactive attitude and a team-oriented mindset, 
                I aim to grow as a developer while delivering value to my future employers.
